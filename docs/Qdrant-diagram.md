Qdrant is a vector database and a tool for conducting vector similarity searches. It operates as an API service, enabling searches for the closest high-dimensional vectors. Using Qdrant, you can transform embeddings or neural network encoders into comprehensive applications for tasks like matching, searching, making recommendations, and much more. Here are some key features of Qdrant:

- Offers OpenAPI v3 specs and ready-made clients for various languages.
- Uses a custom HNSW algorithm for rapid and accurate searches.
- Allows results filtering based on associated vector payloads.
- Supports string matching, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more.
- Cloud-native design with horizontal scaling capabilities.
- Built-in Rust, optimizing resource use with dynamic query planning.
